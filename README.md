## Architecture

This section touches on the architecture of the JavaScript Code, and why it was chosen that way.

Columns contain Cards, and the buttons create new ones with appropriate ID values. These id values allow for cards to then be targeted and moved with Javascript.

The board state is saved in localStorage to allow for persistence.
